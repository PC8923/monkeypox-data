# Monkeypox data

This repository contains dated records of curated Monkeypox cases from the 2022 outbreak (April - ), a data dictionary, and a script used to pull contents from a spreadsheet into JSON and CSV files.

The script is intended for use by the curation team and supporting engineers. It requires access to the relevant Google Sheet, and a Google Cloud service account.

The data dictionary is located in the root directory of this project. It contains information about columns/fields in the data sets.

The archives folder contains dated JSON and CSV files. They are currently uploaded manually; regularly and automatically updated data sets live in an (currently private) S3 bucket.
